Here are the CLI commands used to create the schema. This schema is required for the CDRSearch application.
To input the schema, run the cassandra CLI:
<path to cassandra/bin/cassandra-cli --host <hostname>

Then enter the lines below, one by one (don't enter the comments).  The CLI has an option to run a batch file of commands, but this does not seem to work yet.
